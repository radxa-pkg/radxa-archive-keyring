radxa-archive-keyring (0.2.0) jammy; urgency=medium

  Change the default keyring to radxa-archive-keyring-2024.gpg. Currently
  maintained apt archives are dual signed with both 2023 (old default) and 2024
  keyrings, to ensure smooth migration.

  radxa-archive-keyring-2023.gpg will be expired on 2025-03-02. After this date,
  our apt archives will no longer be signed by this keyring.
